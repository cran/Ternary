\usage{
OutsidePlot(x, y, tolerance = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y}{Vectors of \emph{x} and \emph{y} coordinates of points.}

\item{tolerance}{Consider points this close to the edge of the plot to be
inside.  Set to negative values to count points that are just outside the
plot as inside, and to positive values to count points that are just inside
the margins as outside. Maximum positive value: 1/3.}
}
\value{
Logical vector specifying whether each pair of \emph{x} and \emph{y} coordinates
corresponds to a point outside the plotted ternary diagram.
